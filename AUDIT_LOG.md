# Audit Log — CAD Digitizer

## Critical Issues (unfixed)

### 1. Classification reliability (blocking — everything downstream depends on it)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** FIXED
**Commit:** `ed3a766`
**Impact:** CRITICAL — was causing 8/8 consecutive misfires
**Root cause:** `normalize_furniture_type("table")` returned `generic_2d_furniture` (line 64 of furniture_classifier.py). This type has no dispatch handler, causing the entire pipeline to collapse to `save_generic` with empty geometry. Even when AI vision returned a correct classification, the user-provided `category=table` parameter was being normalized to a useless value.
**Fix:** Changed `"table": "generic_2d_furniture"` → `"table": "rectangular_table"`. Added `"generic_2d_furniture": "rectangular_table"` as AI fallback. Now both user and AI paths reliably dispatch to `save_rectangular_table`.
**Verification:** `table → rectangular_table`, `generic_2d_furniture → rectangular_table`, all 4 DXF views present (TOP, FRONT, SIDE, ISOMETRIC), 0 circles (correct for rectangular).

### 2. DXF front-view missing (front view fix only landed in SVG, not DXF exporter)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** NOT A BUG — classification fix resolves
**Commit:** `ed3a766`
**Evidence:** Verified `save_rectangular_table` already has all 4 views (TOP, FRONT, SIDE, ISOMETRIC) via `_add_polyline` calls. The earlier user observation of "only 1 view" was from the `save_generic` path caused by classification failure. With `table → rectangular_table` fix, all 4 views are present.
**Root cause:** WAS: classification failure calling wrong function. `save_rectangular_table` was always correct.

### 3. Tabletop always renders as circle (wrong for rectangular tables)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** NOT A BUG — classification fix resolves
**Commit:** `ed3a766`
**Evidence:** Verified `save_rectangular_table` uses `_add_polyline` (rectangle), NOT `msp.add_circle`. Current DXF has 0 circles, 23 LWPOLYLINEs, 33 LINES. The `add_circle` calls the user saw belong to `save_round_pedestal_table`, not `save_rectangular_table`.
**Root cause:** WAS: classification failure calling wrong function. `save_rectangular_table` was always correct.

### 4. No deterministic shape detection (always-circle approach)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** NOT A BUG — classification fix resolves
**Evidence:** Round tables dispatch to `round_pedestal_table` (2+ circles in DXF). Rectangular tables dispatch to `rectangular_table` (0 circles). Shape is determined by slug keywords (round/oval/pedestal) → correct template. Verified: Valenza round table = 2 circles, Tangerie = 0 circles.

## Fixed Issues

### F1. Round→rectangular dispatch (fixed, but blocked by issue #1)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Commit:** `f1407c6`
**Fix:** Slug-based shape detection (round/oval/pedestal keywords) maps to correct template. However, this only works when the AI doesn't override the category to `generic_2d_furniture`.

### F2. Variant dimension extraction (fixed)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Commits:** `feafb78`, `db8ea5c`, `90be31f`
**Fix:** Added W/L/H label patterns, mm→cm conversion, median height selection, body_html scanning, length→depth mapping.

### F3. OpenAI API key exposure (fixed)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Commit:** `78200fa`
**Fix:** Key redacted from 3 .env files, .gitignore hardened, old key revoked.

### 5. A `top_shape` signal already exists for coffee tables — but it's computed, used for an unrelated purpose, then discarded before reaching the renderer
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN
**Impact:** MEDIUM — directly relevant to fixing issue #3/#4 (always-circle), but not a ready-made fix as-is
**Evidence:** `routes.py:1455` inside `/digitize/hybrid` computes
`ai_top_shape = 'circle' if 'round' in str(ai_result.get('furniture_type','')).lower() else 'rectangle'`,
then passes it into a `FurnitureAnalysis` object (`routes.py:1472`) that
only feeds `match_template()` — used solely to generate
`uncertainty_questions` for the `SmartConfirmations` UI component, then
discarded. It is **never passed to `_dispatch_furniture()` or
`build_coffee_table_model()`** — confirmed via grep, `ai_top_shape` has
exactly 2 references in the whole file (set once, read once, both inside
the confirmation-question path).
**Root cause / why this isn't a 1-line fix:** the heuristic itself is too
coarse to reuse as-is — it checks for the literal word "round" in the
*furniture_type string*, which for `coffee_table` is always `False`
(the string never contains "round"), so wiring this exact value through
would make every coffee table render as rectangular, including round
ones — flipping issue #3/#4 rather than fixing it. A real fix needs an
actual shape signal (AI vision asked explicitly about top shape, or
derived from width≈depth ratio + page data), not this string match.
**Related:** `required_views` shows the same discard-after-compute
pattern. `FurnitureAnalysis.required_views` defaults to
`['top','front','side']` and `app/furniture_intelligence/services/
vision_prompt.py`/`vision_service.py` ask for an even fuller
`['top','front','side','section','isometric']` — but nothing in
`_dispatch_furniture`/`dxf_exporter.py` ever reads `required_views` to
decide which views to actually draw. It only flows into
`furniture_intelligence/geometry/preview_generator.py`'s own preview
text and the confirmation-question metadata — never into the real DXF
view count, which is hardcoded per-function as documented in issues #2/#3
above. The `furniture_intelligence` module independently "knows" a coffee
table should get 5 views; `dxf_exporter.py` independently gives it 1; they
never talk to each other.

### 6. Post-generation slider/Apply UI silently does nothing for 7 of 13 furniture types
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN
**Impact:** HIGH — affects every type added after the original round/rect
table templates (coffee_table, cabinet, sofa, dining_chair, wardrobe,
bed_headboard, reception_counter); user sees zero feedback
**Evidence:** `/adjust` (`routes.py:2224`) has its own independent
if/elif furniture-type dispatch (separate from `_dispatch_furniture` used
at initial generation) covering only `round_pedestal_table`,
`rectangular_table`, `oval_pedestal_table`, `console_table`,
`office_desk`, `asymmetric_pedestal_table`. For any other type it correctly
returns `{"error": "Unsupported type: <ftype>"}, status_code=400`
(`routes.py:2375`) — the backend is not silently failing here.
**The real bug is in the frontend**: `SliderPanel.tsx:158-160` does
`const data = await resp.json(); if (data.preview_svg) { onAdjusted(...) }`
— no check for `data.error`, no `res.ok` check, no `console.error` for the
non-network-failure case. A 400 response with a valid JSON error body is
not a fetch() exception, so the `catch` block never fires either. Net
result: drag a slider on a coffee table (or cabinet/sofa/etc.), click
Apply, and **nothing happens with zero indication why** — no error toast,
no console warning, no visual change. Confirmed by reading the exact
condition; this is a one-line fix (check `data.error` and surface it)
once someone decides what the surfaced message should say.

**The real fix for the underlying gap is already sitting right next to
it.** `/material/edit` (`routes.py:2419`) solves the exact same "which
save/build function for this furniture_type" problem via
`_get_adjust_fn(furniture_type)` → `FURNITURE_ADJUST_DISPATCH`
(`routes.py:2184`), a shared lookup table that **already covers all 13
furniture types** (confirmed by reading the dict literal — round_pedestal,
rectangular, cabinet, sofa, coffee_table, dining_chair, wardrobe,
reception_counter, bed_headboard, asymmetric/oval pedestal, console,
office_desk). `/adjust` just never adopted it — it hand-rolls its own
separate, 6-type-only if/elif instead of calling the same
`_get_adjust_fn()` that's one function away. This isn't a "write 7 new
branches" fix, it's "delete `/adjust`'s own dispatch chain and call
`_get_adjust_fn()` like `/material/edit` already does" — same "two
parallel implementations of the same lookup, one more complete than the
other" shape as the SVG-preview-vs-DXF-exporter issue above.

### 7. Chat sessions: yet another duplicate-implementation pair (Postgres table built and fixed, never actually used)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN (not broken, just dead weight + confusing for whoever
touches this next)
**Impact:** LOW functionally (the file-based store works fine), but worth
knowing before "fixing" the wrong one
**Evidence:** `routes.py:2951` defines `_CHAT_STORE = OUT / "chat_sessions.json"`
and every chat-session read/write in `routes.py` goes through that file —
confirmed via grep, zero references to `brain_sync.py`'s
`save_chat_session`/`load_chat_session` (Postgres-backed, table created
earlier in this audit pass) anywhere in `routes.py`. Same shape as the
`style_presets` duplication noted earlier this session: a Postgres
implementation exists, has a real table, but the actual live feature uses
a completely independent file-based store instead. Not urgent to unify,
but anyone who sees the Postgres `chat_sessions` table with rows in it (or
without) should not assume that reflects real chat activity — it doesn't,
the JSON file does.

### 8. Clarification: of the 10 tables created from `01-init-schema.sql` earlier this audit, only 2 are actually used by any code
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** INFORMATIONAL — re-scopes an earlier finding, not a new bug
**Impact:** none functionally (creating them was harmless and correct —
`drawing_history`/`comparison_results` genuinely needed it), but corrects
the impression that fixing the schema "activated" a broad closed-loop
system. It activated exactly two tables' worth of feature.
**Evidence:** grepped every `app/**/*.py` for each table name (not just
`brain_sync.py` — the whole backend):

| Table | Referenced in app code? |
|---|---|
| `comparison_results` | **Yes** — `comparison_agent.py`, `/compare` endpoint |
| `drawing_history` | **Yes** — `brain_sync.py:record_drawing`, called from `routes.py` |
| `digitizer_sessions` | No — zero references anywhere |
| `digitizer_results` | No — zero references anywhere |
| `feedback_learnings` | No — zero references anywhere |
| `proportion_ledger` | No — zero references; **note this is a different table from `component_proportions`** (the one `record_proportion`/`get_proportion_estimate` actually use, from `create_ml_tables.sql`). Easy to confuse the two by name later — `proportion_ledger` sounds like it should be the live one and isn't. |
| `validation_results` | Effectively no — only ever appears in a `DELETE ... WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL` cleanup statement (`routes.py:3919`). Nothing inserts into it, ever. The cleanup job will run forever deleting 0 rows. |
| `training_exports` | No — zero references anywhere |
| `product_families` | No real table query — `validate_all_product_families()` exists in `validation_service.py` but operates on data passed in (almost certainly `resources/product_catalog/_registry.json`, not this table); the name similarity is coincidental/misleading |
| `chat_sessions` | No (from `routes.py`'s perspective) — see finding #7 above, file-based store is the real one |

**Takeaway for whoever picks this up:** before building anything new on
top of `digitizer_sessions`/`digitizer_results`/`feedback_learnings`/
`proportion_ledger`/`validation_results`/`training_exports`/
`product_families`, confirm whether the intent is to actually wire them
up now, or whether they're legacy/aspirational and safe to drop. Don't
assume they're load-bearing just because they exist in the schema.

### 9. `/brain/*` family: 1 of 3 endpoints reachable from the UI; the proportion-ledger fix from earlier in this audit still has no visibility surface
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN
**Impact:** MEDIUM — the data now accumulates correctly (per the schema
fix earlier this audit) but a user/operator has no way to ever see what
the proportion ledger has learned, and material suggestions never reach
an editing UI
**Evidence:** Three endpoints exist: `GET /brain/report` (`routes.py:2818`),
`GET /brain/proportions` (`routes.py:2823`), `GET /brain/materials`
(`routes.py:2831`). Grepped frontend for all three — only `/brain/report`
is called, from `BrainStats.tsx:18`, which **is** rendered in `App.tsx`
(confirmed reachable, not orphaned). `/brain/proportions` and
`/brain/materials` have zero frontend callers.
**What this means concretely:** `get_intelligence_report()` (backing
`/brain/report`) queries `furniture_corrections`/`material_library` —
both real, both populated since the schema fix earlier this audit — so
the stats panel users actually see is genuinely live and correct. But the
*specific* proportion-ledger numbers (`component_proportions` —
per-furniture-type base/neck/collar ratios with sample counts) that
`_ledger_blend()` reads and writes on every round-pedestal-table digitize
have no endpoint a user ever reaches; `/brain/proportions` exists to
serve exactly this and is wired correctly on the backend, just never
called. Material suggestions (`get_material_suggestions()`, backing
`/brain/materials`) are similarly fully implemented and never surfaced
in the material-editing UI (`SliderPanel.tsx`'s material fields are
plain text inputs with no suggestion/autocomplete wired to this
endpoint).
**Fix is UI-only** — both backend endpoints already work; this needs a
frontend call site, not backend changes.

### 10. `cad_intelligence` (structured entity extraction + confidence scoring) computed in the default flow, included in every response, never read by the frontend
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN
**Impact:** LOW-MEDIUM — doesn't break anything, but a real per-entity
confidence signal is computed on every digitize and thrown away client-side
**Evidence:** `routes.py:1513-1630` (inside `/digitize/hybrid`, the default
engine mode) runs `run_cad_intelligence_pipeline()`, builds `CadEntity`
objects with confidence scores, and includes the full result as
`cad_intelligence` in the response (`routes.py:1793`). Grepped frontend for
`cad_intelligence` — one hit, a comment in `cadEngine.ts:403`, no actual
field read anywhere in `App.tsx` or any component. Same shape as findings
#9/CFG above: real computation in the critical path, silently discarded
on arrival.

### 11. Visibility-toggle crash: 3 of the 6 types `/adjust` "supports" will throw an uncaught TypeError if a user hides/shows any component
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN
**Impact:** HIGH for affected types — round_pedestal_table is the
default/most-used furniture type
**Evidence:** `/adjust` (`routes.py:2224`) unconditionally does
`save_kwargs['visibility'] = visibility_overrides` (line ~2379) for
whichever furniture type, then calls `save_fn(str(dxf_path), **save_kwargs)`
(wrapped in try/except — fails silently if visibility isn't accepted) and
`model = build_fn(**save_kwargs)` (**not wrapped in any try/except**).
Checked every `build_*_model()` signature in `drawing_builders.py` for
the 6 types `/adjust` actually has a `save_kwargs` branch for:

| Type | `build_*_model` accepts `visibility`? |
|---|---|
| `round_pedestal_table` | **No** — confirmed signature has no `visibility` param |
| `oval_pedestal_table` | **No** |
| `asymmetric_pedestal_table` | **No** |
| `rectangular_table` | Yes |
| `console_table` | Yes |
| `office_desk` | Yes |

For the 3 "No" types, `save_fn(...)` succeeds first (the DXF *exporter*
versions — `save_round_pedestal_table` confirmed to accept `visibility` —
do support it), so the downloadable DXF file gets correctly updated on
disk, but the immediately-following `build_fn(**save_kwargs)` call raises
an uncaught `TypeError: build_round_pedestal_model() got an unexpected
keyword argument 'visibility'`. This propagates to the outer
`except Exception as e: return JSONResponse({"error": f"Adjust failed:
{e}"}, status_code=500)` — so the user gets a 500 (compounded by finding
#6 above: `SliderPanel.tsx` doesn't surface `data.error` either way, so
even this clear backend error never reaches the user visually). Net
effect for round_pedestal_table specifically: toggle a component's
visibility off, the DXF file silently updates correctly, the SVG preview
the user is actually looking at does not, and no error is shown anywhere.
**Fix:** add `visibility` parameter + handling to `build_round_pedestal_model`,
`build_oval_pedestal_model`, `build_asymmetric_pedestal_model` (mirroring
the `_component_visible()` pattern already present in
`build_rectangular_table_model`/`build_cabinet_model`/`build_sofa_model`),
or wrap `build_fn(**save_kwargs)` in try/except as a stopgap (doesn't fix
the missing visibility support, just stops the 500).
**Checked for the same gap on `materials`** (the older, originally-built
parameter) — confirmed present on all of `build_round_pedestal_model`,
`build_oval_pedestal_model`, `build_asymmetric_pedestal_model`. The gap is
specific to `visibility` (added later, inconsistently), not a general
pattern across every kwarg these functions accept.

### 12. Correction to an earlier-session finding: crawler-worker DOES notify python-worker — the real gap is one step downstream, and it's severe (outputs written to a directory that auto-deletes itself)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN — and this correction matters, don't re-investigate the
already-disproven half of it
**Impact:** HIGH — explains why `ProductReference`/`ReferenceAsset` stay
empty despite real crawl activity; not a missing connection, a missing
implementation
**Correction:** an earlier finding this session said crawler-worker never
pushes a `crawl_result` job back to the queue. That was checked only in
`crawler-worker/worker.js`, which is correct in isolation — but the actual
push happens inside `crawler-worker/crawlers/genericProductCrawler.js`
(lines ~401-415: `lPush("cad-processing", JSON.stringify({type:
"crawl_result", data: {...}}))`), a different file. **The queue handoff
from crawler-worker → python-worker is real and wired** — `queue_worker.py`
genuinely consumes `crawl_result` jobs via `handle_crawl_result_job` →
`process_crawled_assets` (`app/services/crawl_processor.py`).
**The actual gap, one layer further in:** `crawl_processor.py`'s module
docstring claims 5 steps including "5. Saves metadata to Postgres."
Read the full implementation of `_process_cad_file()` — there is **no
Postgres write anywhere in the file** (grepped: zero `INSERT`/`cursor`/
`psycopg2`/ORM calls). Worse: the downloaded CAD file, the parsed
`geometry.json`, and the generated `preview.svg` are all written inside
`with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp:` — which Python deletes the
instant the `with` block exits, i.e. before the function even returns.
The only thing that survives is the Qdrant embedding vector
(`index_geometry()` call) — the actual files and parsed geometry are
computed and then physically destroyed, not just unread. `_process_image()`
is even thinner: downloads nothing, parses nothing, just returns
`{"status": "completed"}` with a comment "For now, just mark as
completed. Future: generate thumbnails, OCR, etc."
**This fully explains** the empty `ProductReference`/`ReferenceAsset`
tables noted earlier in this audit — it was never a wiring gap between
services, it's that the metadata-persistence step described in the
docstring was never actually written.
**Fix:** add the actual Postgres write (create/update `ProductReference`
+ `ReferenceAsset` rows via Prisma or direct SQL, matching what
`backend-node/src/services/productReferenceService.ts` already does for
the manually-triggered `/api/product-references/:id/process-dxf` path —
that endpoint's logic is the template to reuse here) and persist the
geometry JSON / SVG preview somewhere durable (Spaces, alongside the
already-uploaded raw asset — not the temp dir) before the `with` block
exits.

### 13. Whole-pipeline summary: the bulk crawler-worker system (finding #12) is also unreachable from the frontend entirely
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN — ties #12 together with a reachability gap on top
**Impact:** clarifies scope — this is not a half-broken user-facing
feature, it's an entirely separate, currently API-only subsystem
**Evidence:** grepped all of `frontend/` for `/api/crawl` (the bulk
crawler-worker trigger endpoint, `backend-node/src/routes/crawl.ts`) —
zero matches. The "Crawl Product URL" tab in the actual UI
(`CrawlInput.tsx`) only ever calls `/crawl-to-dxf` on python-worker (a
separate, much simpler httpx-based single-request crawl, already covered
extensively elsewhere in this log under the Melina/Tangerie testing).
**Combined picture:** the bulk pipeline (Playwright stealth crawling,
robots.txt compliance check, S3/Spaces upload, dead-letter retry queue,
Qdrant indexing, the queue handoff to python-worker) is real,
substantial, partially well-built engineering — and currently runs only
if someone calls `POST /api/crawl` directly with a valid `x-api-key`.
Even when it does run, finding #12 means the most valuable output
(parsed geometry + preview, catalog metadata) never persists anywhere
durable. Before investing in wiring this into the UI, fix #12 first —
there's no point exposing a "browse what we've crawled" feature when the
crawl step throws away everything except a vector embedding.

### 14. Context for `app/resource_engine/{reasoning,param_pack,manufacturing,fusion}` (previously flagged as "zero callers" — here's what it actually is, for whoever decides what to do with it)
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** INFORMATIONAL — this is a product/scope decision, not a bug
to patch
**Impact:** N/A directly, but materially changes the "should we connect
this or delete it" calculus once you see what it actually does
**What it is:** a complete second pipeline, clearly built across multiple
sessions (commit history references "7-phase Product DNA Architecture",
"Phase 1/2/3/5/7", "Phase 3C-2/3/4A/4B"), intended to run *after* vision
features are extracted and *before* (or instead of) the current simple
template dispatch:
- `param_pack/`: `VisionFeatures → GeometryDecomposer → DimensionEstimator
  → CADParameterPack` (turns raw vision output into a structured
  parameter set)
- `reasoning/`: a genuine multi-agent system —
  `GeometryAgent`/`DimensionAgent`/`MaterialAgent`/`JoineryAgent`/
  `ValidationAgent`, run through an `AgentScheduler` and a
  `ConflictResolver`, producing an `EngineeringDecision` (this is the kind
  of "the AI debates with itself and resolves disagreements" pattern,
  fully built, not a stub)
- `manufacturing/`: `CADParameterPack → assembly steps, cutting list, weld
  schedule, finish schedule, packaging plan, risk list, QC checklist →
  ReadyForCADPackage` — i.e. actual production/manufacturing
  documentation, not just a drawing
- `fusion/`: merges every agent's output by explicit priority
  ("validation corrections > specs > manufacturing > dimensions >
  references > vision > defaults") into one `EngineeringDecisionPackage`
  + `ParametricCADSceneGraph` + `AuditTrail`
**Why this matters:** the currently-*live* product just maps AI vision
output + OCR text onto one of 13 hardcoded template functions with
manually-tuned default ratios (everything else in this audit log). This
parallel system represents a materially more ambitious product —
auditable multi-agent engineering decisions and real manufacturing
output, not just a 2D drawing. It is fully unreachable today (confirmed
earlier: zero callers from `routes.py`, `main.py`, or any frontend code).
**This is not a "wire it up" one-liner** — connecting it properly means
deciding where in the existing `/digitize/hybrid` flow it would plug in,
what happens to the current template-dispatch system (replace it?
run alongside it?), and whether the manufacturing-pipeline output has
anywhere to go in the current product (no UI for cutting lists/QC
checklists exists anywhere today). Flagging as a scope decision for
the user, not a fix.

### 15. New "Interactive Parametric CAD Previewer" feature (commit `01b7558`): live skeleton preview's shape-matching logic misses 3 of the most common table types
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN
**Impact:** MEDIUM — feature works and is genuinely wired end-to-end
(rare in this log!), but renders the wrong/generic skeleton shape for
`rectangular_table`, `console_table`, `side_table`
**What this feature is and confirms working:** `TemplatesPage.tsx` now
debounces slider changes (400ms) and calls `GET /skeleton/{product_type}`
live, rendering an SVG skeleton preview that updates as you drag —
confirmed wired correctly: frontend passes `template.product_type`
(verified via `TemplatesPage.tsx:32,173`), endpoint exists
(`routes.py:4189`), calls `generate_skeleton()` in
`app/backend/svg_skeleton.py`, returns real SVG. This is one of the few
features in this whole audit that's actually fully connected
frontend-to-backend with no missing link.
**The bug:** `generate_skeleton()`'s archetype-matching (`svg_skeleton.py`
~line 570) picks which skeleton builder to use via substring keyword
matching on the *product_type string itself*:
```python
if any(k in fl for k in ["sofa", "bench", "sofa_bench"]): ... # sofa skeleton
elif any(k in fl for k in ["dining_table", "coffee_table", "pedestal_table"]): ... # table skeleton
elif any(k in fl for k in ["chair", "armchair", "lounge", "stool"]): ... # chair skeleton
elif any(k in fl for k in ["pendant", "chandelier"]): ... # pendant skeleton
else: ... # generic skeleton
```
The table branch checks for the literal compound substrings
`"dining_table"`/`"coffee_table"`/`"pedestal_table"` — not a general
`"table" in fl` check. Verified live against all 18 real templates:
`coffee_table`, `round_pedestal_table`, `oval_pedestal_table`,
`asymmetric_pedestal_table` correctly match (their names contain
`"coffee_table"`/`"pedestal_table"`) and render proper table skeletons
(labeled "Top" + two leg rectangles, confirmed via curl). **But
`rectangular_table`, `console_table`, and `side_table` contain none of
those 3 substrings** and fall to the generic branch — confirmed live,
all three return the generic skeleton's labels ("Tabletop"/"Base Support
Or Legs"/"Legs Or Frame", the exact same fallback shape, not an
actual rectangular-table-shaped skeleton with legs in the right place).
`office_desk` and `reception_counter` also don't match any branch and
get the generic fallback — arguably more defensible for those (no
table-specific keyword was ever intended to cover them), but worth a
look too.
**Fix:** change the table-branch check to `"table" in fl` (or an
explicit allowlist of all table-family `product_type` values), matching
how the sofa/chair branches already work more permissively.

**Minor naming note, same feature:** the commit message describes the
"Preview DXF" button as generating a "DXF→skeleton overlay." Checked the
actual implementation (`TemplatesPage.tsx:168-177`) — it does not touch
a real DXF at all. It calls `/templates/suggest` to get
`solved_dimensions`, then calls `/skeleton/{type}` again with those
resolved values, and renders the result in its own separate box
(`dxfSvg` state, `TemplatesPage.tsx:220-223`) below the live slider
skeleton — not overlaid on anything. Functionally it works fine (renders
a real, reasonable SVG, doesn't crash) and is arguably useful (compares
"what the sliders say" vs "what the suggest-resolver would pick"), just
mislabeled — there's no actual DXF generation or overlay happening, so
don't go looking for one if debugging this area.

### 16. Same commit, backend half: new `bed` dispatch branch draws a headboard-only panel for what's classified as a full platform bed
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** OPEN
**Impact:** MEDIUM — affects every product correctly classified as a full
bed rather than just a headboard
**Evidence:** `furniture_classifier.py`'s alias map deliberately
distinguishes two types: `"bed": "bed"` / `"platform_bed": "bed"` (a full
bed) vs. `"bed_headboard": "bed_headboard"` / `"headboard": "bed_headboard"`
(just the headboard panel) — these are intentionally different
classification outputs. But the new `elif f_type == 'bed':` branch added
in commit `01b7558` (`routes.py:1061`) calls
`save_bed_headboard(str(dxf_path), width_cm=w, height_cm=h,
materials=materials)` — **the exact same function** used for the
`bed_headboard` case. Confirmed via `save_bed_headboard`'s own docstring:
"Bed headboard with headboard panel, legs, and dimensions" — it draws a
flat panel + legs, nothing else. Net effect: a product correctly
classified as a full platform bed (the classifier did its job right)
gets rendered as just a headboard, with no mattress platform outline,
footboard, or actual bed footprint — the type distinction is made and
then discarded one function call later.
**Fix:** either build a real `save_bed_model`/`build_bed_model` (platform
outline + headboard + optional footboard, matching the depth dimension
this branch already computes at line 1062 but never uses for anything
beyond `resolved_dimensions`), or — if a dedicated bed-frame drawing
isn't worth building yet — collapse `bed` back into `bed_headboard` in
the classifier alias map until one exists, so the distinction isn't
silently made and then lost.
**Confirmed consistent across both code paths:** `_build_svg_model`'s
`bed` branch (`routes.py:1244`) calls `build_bed_headboard_model()` too —
same gap in the live SVG preview the user actually sees, not just the
downloadable DXF. Whoever fixes this needs to touch both.

**Side note, same commit, lower risk:** also checked `side_table →
save_rectangular_table` and `nightstand → save_cabinet` for the same
class of mismatch — both are reasonable semantic mappings (a side table
genuinely is a small rectangular table; a nightstand genuinely is a
small cabinet), no equivalent bug found there.

### 17. Re-audit of fix commit `1dc78f9` (claims to close #11/#6/#9): #11 is a half-fix — crash stopped, feature still doesn't work; #6 and #9 verified correct
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** #11 PARTIALLY FIXED (crash only) — #6 FIXED — #9 PARTIALLY FIXED (reachable now, response shapes still wrong)

**#11 (visibility crash) — half-fixed, re-opening the functional half.**
The commit adds a `visibility` parameter and a `_component_visible()`
helper to `build_round_pedestal_model`, `build_oval_pedestal_model`,
`build_asymmetric_pedestal_model` (`drawing_builders.py`). This
genuinely stops the `TypeError` — confirmed the parameter now exists, so
`build_fn(**save_kwargs)` no longer crashes. **But `_component_visible()`
is defined and never called** — verified by counting occurrences of
`_component_visible(` in each function's full body: exactly 1 in each
(the `def` line itself), zero actual call sites gating any
`polygons.append`/etc. So: toggle a component's visibility off on a
round/oval/asymmetric pedestal table, the request no longer 500s, but
the component is still drawn regardless — the original feature gap
(visibility toggle has no effect) is unchanged, just no longer crashes.
**Remaining fix:** wrap the relevant `front_view.polygons.append(...)` /
`top_view.circles.append(...)` calls in `if _component_visible("name"):`
checks, the same way `build_rectangular_table_model`/`build_cabinet_model`/
`build_sofa_model` already do it (those are the reference implementation
— go copy the pattern from there).

**#6 (slider error surfacing) — verified fixed.** Checked
`SliderPanel.tsx`'s current `applyDims()` — now checks `data.error` after
`resp.json()` and sets an `errorMsg` state rendered as an inline red
banner. Confirmed the condition is no longer just `if (data.preview_svg)`
silently doing nothing on error.

**#9 (brain endpoints UI) — correction: both endpoints are now called
(reachability is genuinely fixed), but neither response shape matches
what the frontend reads, so real data still won't display.** Initial
grep for the literal string `"brain/proportions"` found nothing — that
was a false negative, the code builds the URL via an `apiUrl(path)`
template helper (`apiUrl('proportions')`/`apiUrl('materials')`), confirmed
present on reading the full file. Both fetches do fire. But:
- `GET /brain/proportions` (verified live) returns
  `{"estimate": null, "note": "Not enough data yet"}` or
  `{"estimate": {...}}` — a **single point lookup** for one
  `(furniture_type, anchor_dimension, anchor_value, component)` tuple,
  using its default query params since `BrainStats.tsx` calls it with no
  params at all. The frontend does
  `if (prop?.proportions) setProportions(prop.proportions)` — there is no
  `proportions` key in the actual response, ever, so this branch never
  fires regardless of how much real data accumulates.
- `GET /brain/materials` (verified live) returns
  `{"component": "tabletop", "suggestions": [...]}`. The frontend does
  `if (mat) setMaterials(mat)` — sets the **entire response object**
  (including the literal keys `"component"` and `"suggestions"`) as the
  `materials` state, then renders `Object.entries(materials)` as if each
  entry were a learned material. Once `suggestions` is ever non-empty,
  this would render `component: tabletop` and `suggestions: [...]` as two
  garbled "materials" rows, not real per-material data.
- **Currently invisible because both are empty** (no real learned data
  yet) — `0 proportions, 0 materials` happens to look plausible by
  coincidence. This will visibly break (always shows 0/garbled,
  regardless of real counts) the moment either table has real rows.
- **Fix:** either change the endpoints to return what a "browse
  everything learned" UI actually needs (a list, not a single-tuple
  lookup for proportions; a clean array for materials, not the wrapper
  object), or change `BrainStats.tsx` to call them with real, meaningful
  parameters per furniture type and read the actual response shape
  (`estimate`/`suggestions`) correctly instead of assuming a `proportions`
  array that was never going to exist.

### 18. Audit of commit `5dac3e3` (TOP/ISOMETRIC views + proportional legs + unit fix): the DXF-side fix is genuinely correct, but it's DXF-only — SVG preview now drifts further out of sync
**Date:** 2026-06-29
**Status:** PARTIALLY FIXED — DXF exporter correct, SVG preview not touched

**The good news, verified correct:** `save_cabinet`/`save_sofa`/
`save_wardrobe` in `dxf_exporter.py` now genuinely produce 4 views each
(FRONT, TOP, SIDE, ISOMETRIC), and TOP/SIDE views include a real
`f'D = {depth_cm:g} cm'` dimension label using the actual `depth_cm`
parameter (not a hardcoded value) — confirmed by reading the rendered
text directly. This correctly resolves the depth-dimensioning gap noted
earlier in this log for these 3 types. Also confirmed `save_dining_chair`
already independently has a SIDE view with a real depth dimension (fixed
by something else, not this commit) and `save_bed_headboard` correctly
remains FRONT-only (legitimate — it doesn't even accept `depth_cm`).

**The gap:** this commit only touched `dxf_exporter.py` (confirmed via
`git show 5dac3e3 --stat` — one file). Checked `drawing_builders.py` (the
SVG preview builders, what a user sees in-browser *before* downloading)
directly: `build_cabinet_model()`, `build_sofa_model()`,
`build_wardrobe_model()` still each return only `['FRONT VIEW']` — no
TOP, no SIDE, no ISOMETRIC, no depth dimension anywhere. This is the
exact same "preview vs DXF exporter drift" shape flagged earlier in this
log for coffee_table, now recurring for 3 more types: **the file you
download now correctly shows depth and 4 views; the preview you looked
at before deciding to download it still doesn't.**
**Fix:** port the same TOP VIEW (with `D = ... cm` dimension) + ISOMETRIC
VIEW treatment from `dxf_exporter.py`'s versions into
`build_cabinet_model`/`build_sofa_model`/`build_wardrobe_model` in
`drawing_builders.py`. The DXF-side code is the correct reference to
copy from now.

**Separate bug in the same commit, "unit cm fix" part — verified
incorrect, makes the original problem worse.** The commit message claims
"Fix dimension unit inconsistency: mm→cm in save_oval_pedestal_table,
save_console_table, save_office_desk, save_asymmetric_pedestal_table
title blocks." Checked the actual diff (`git show 5dac3e3 -- dxf_exporter.py`,
hunk list via `grep "^@@"`): **`save_console_table` and
`save_asymmetric_pedestal_table` were never touched at all** — not in the
diff. `save_oval_pedestal_table` and `save_office_desk` each got exactly
one line changed:
- `save_oval_pedestal_table`: only the pedestal-diameter dimension label
  (`Ø{...}`) changed from `*10 ... mm` to plain `... cm`. The width
  dimension right next to it (`W = {length_cm * 10:g} mm`) and the top
  thickness dimension (`T = {top_thick_cm * 10:g} mm`) are **unchanged,
  still mm**.
- `save_office_desk`: only the modesty-panel-height label (`MH = ...`)
  changed to cm. The width label (`W = {length_cm * 10:g} mm`) right next
  to it is unchanged, still mm.
- Also: no title block text was touched in either function — the
  commit's own description ("...title blocks") doesn't match the diff at
  all; the actual changes are to in-drawing dimension labels, not title
  blocks.

**Net effect: these two drawings are now more internally inconsistent
than before, not less.** Previously every dimension in
`save_oval_pedestal_table` was uniformly in mm (a real inconsistency
with the rest of the codebase's cm convention, but at least consistent
*within* that one drawing). Now the same drawing shows e.g.
`W = 1800mm`, `Ø80cm`, `T = 30mm` side by side — two different units on
one sheet, which is a worse manufacturing-drawing defect than a
codebase-wide convention mismatch.
**Fix:** in each of the 4 named functions, convert *every* dimension
label in the function to the same unit (cm, matching the rest of the
codebase's convention — drop the `* 10`/`mm` entirely), not just the one
line that happened to get edited. `save_console_table` and
`save_asymmetric_pedestal_table` still need the fix applied at all, not
just the other two finishing it properly.

## Remaining (not yet addressed)

1. **Shopify JSON direct parse** — skip the two-independent-guesses pattern
2. **`ai_top_shape` deep wiring** — `coffee_table_round` type exists but `top_shape` signal from AI vision still isn't passed to SVG renderer for non-coffee-table types
3. **Bed vs headboard distinction** — `bed` type normalizes to `bed_headboard`, losing the platform-bed geometry the classifier intentionally produces
